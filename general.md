# General Troubleshooting with Anchore

This guide will walkthrough some general troubleshooting tips with your Anchore Engine instance. When troubleshooting Anchore Engine, the recommend approach is to first verify all Anchore services are up, use the event subsystem to narrow down particular issues, and then navigate to the logs for specific services to find out more information.

If you are running into issues performing certain Anchore operations (examples: images are failing analysis or cannot access a private registry) please consult the [FAQs](faqs.md) document. 

Throughout this guide, Anchore CLI commands will be executed to assist with troubleshooting. For more information on the Anchore CLI, please reference the CLI section.

## Verifying Services

Verify that the following Anchore Engine services are up

- Service analyzer
- Service policy_engine
- Service catalog
- Service apiext
- Service simplequeue

You can do so by running: `anchore-cli system status`

```
anchore-cli system status
Service analyzer (dockerhostid-anchore-engine, http://anchore-engine:8084): up
Service policy_engine (dockerhostid-anchore-engine, http://anchore-engine:8087): up
Service catalog (dockerhostid-anchore-engine, http://anchore-engine:8082): up
Service apiext (dockerhostid-anchore-engine, http://anchore-engine:8228): up
Service simplequeue (dockerhostid-anchore-engine, http://anchore-engine:8083): up

Engine DB Version: 0.0.9
Engine Code Version: 0.3.4
```

**Note:** If specific services are down, you can investigate the logs for the services. See [Logs Section](#logs)

### The --debug and --json options

Passing the `--debug` option to any Anchore CLI can often help narrow down particular issues. 

```
# Example system status with --debug
root@4c0a95557659:/anchore-engine# anchore-cli --debug system status
INFO:anchorecli.clients.apiexternal:As Account = None
DEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:Starting new HTTP connection (1): localhost:8228
DEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:http://localhost:8228 "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 5
INFO:anchorecli.clients.apiexternal:As Account = None
DEBUG:anchorecli.clients.apiexternal:GET url=http://localhost:8228/system

DEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:http://localhost:8228 "GET /system HTTP/1.1" 200 2672
DEBUG:anchorecli.cli.utils:fetched httpcode from response: 200
Service analyzer (dockerhostid-anchore-engine, http://anchore-engine:8084): up
Service policy_engine (dockerhostid-anchore-engine, http://anchore-engine:8087): up
Service catalog (dockerhostid-anchore-engine, http://anchore-engine:8082): up
Service apiext (dockerhostid-anchore-engine, http://anchore-engine:8228): up
Service simplequeue (dockerhostid-anchore-engine, http://anchore-engine:8083): up
```

Passing the `--json` option to any Anchore CLI commands will output the data in JSON format.

```
# Example system status with --json
root@4c0a95557659:/anchore-engine# anchore-cli --json system status
{
    "service_states": [
        {
            "base_url": "http://anchore-engine:8087",
            "hostid": "dockerhostid-anchore-engine",
            "service_detail": {
                "available": true,
                "busy": false,
                "db_version": "0.0.9",
                "detail": {},
                "message": "all good",
                "up": true,
                "version": "0.3.4"
            },
            "servicename": "policy_engine",
            "status": true,
            "status_message": "available",
            "version": "v1"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

## Events

If you've successfully verified that all of the Anchore Engine sevices are up, but are still running into issues operating Anchore a good place check is the event log. 

The event log subsystem provides users with a mechanism to inspect asynchronous event occuring across various Anchore Engine services. Anchore events include periodically triggered activities such as vulnerability data feed sync in the policy_engine service, image analysis failures originating from the analyzer service, and other informational or system fault events. The catalog service may also generate events for any repositories or image tags that are being watched, when Anchore Engine encounters connectivity, authentication, authorization or other errors in the process of checking for updates. 

The event log is aimed at troubleshooting most common failure scenarios (especially those that happen during asynchronous engine operations) and to pinpoint the reasons for failures, that can be used subsequently to help with corrective actions. Events can be cleared from Anchore Engine in bulk or individually. 

### Viewing Events

Running the following command will give a list of recent Anchore events: `anchore-cli event list`

```
# Viewing list of recent Anchore events

root@4c0a95557659:/anchore-engine# anchore-cli event list

```

### Details about a specific event

If you would like more information about a specific event, you can run the following command: `anchore-cli event get <event-id>`

```
# Details about a specific Anchore event

root@4c0a95557659:/anchore-engine# anchore-cli event get 7f6dc74c8c8348ecad97f2f54ad488d6
details:
  sync_feed_types:
  - vulnerabilities
level: INFO
message: Feed sync started
resource:
  type: feeds
  user_id: admin
source:
  base_url: http://localhost:8087
  hostid: anchore-quickstart
  servicename: policy_engine
timestamp: '2019-02-06T04:15:11.372306Z'
type: feed_sync_start
```

**Note:** Depending on the output from the detailed events, looking into the logs for a particular servicename (example: policy_engine) is the next troubleshooting step.  

## Logs

Anchore logs can be accessed by executing into the Anchore container and navigating to `/var/log/anchore`. From this location you can access logs for specific services (if co-located each of the service logs will be available for access under this directory).

```
# Example logs
# Co-located Anchore Engine installation 

root@4c0a95557659:/var/log/anchore# ls
anchore-api.log                 anchore-simplequeue.log     anchore-catalog.log             anchore-policy-engine.log  anchore-worker.log
```
