# Anchore Troubleshooting FAQs

For each of the following frequently asked questions, read the [General Troubleshooting Approach Guide](general.md) first, then following the data from there, follow the query specific answers below.

**Note:** As stated in the [General Troubleshooting Approach Guide](general.md), passing the `--debug` option to any Anchore CLI command can often help narrow down particular issues. 

## Unauthorized error when using the Anchore CLI

If you run into an `"Unauthorized"` error, verify you have configured the Anchore CLI correctly, as this error is most commonly seen when the Username, Password, or Service URL are improperly set. 

By default the Anchore CLI will try to connect to the Anchore Engine at `http://localhost:8228/v1` with no authentication. The username, password and URL for the server can be passed to the Anchore CLI as command line arguments. 

```
--u   TEXT   Username     eg. admin (default)
--p   TEXT   Password     eg. foobar (default)
--url TEXT   Service URL  eg. http://localhost:8228/v1
```

Rather than passing these parameters for every call to the cli they can be stores as environment variables.

```
ANCHORE_CLI_URL=http://myserver.example.com:8228/v1
ANCHORE_CLI_USER=admin
ANCHORE_CLI_PASS=foobar
```

**Note:** When passing the parameters through the command line, order matters. For example, `anchore-cli --url http://localhost:8228/v1 --u admin --p foobar system status`

## No vulnerability results for an analyzed image

In order to return vulnerability results on analyzed images feed data must be synced. 

### Verifying feed data

The following command will report a list of feeds synced by Anchore: `anchore-cli system feeds list`

```
anchore-cli system feeds list
Feed                   Group                  LastSync                          RecordCount

### Waiting for Anchore feed data to sync

**Note:** Upon a fresh installation of Anchore Engine, the system will take some time to bootstrap. CVE data for Linux distributions such as Alpine, CentOS, Debian, Oracle, Red Hat and Ubuntu will be downloaded. The initial sync may take anywhere from  10 to 60 minutes depending on the speed of your network connection. 

You can run the following command to wait until Anchore Engine is available and ready. This can be useful when waiting for vulnerability data to sync on intial installation. `anchore-cli system wait`

```
# Blocking operation that will return when anchore-engine is available and ready

root@4c0a95557659:/anchore-engine# anchore-cli system wait
Starting checks to wait for anchore-engine to be available timeout=-1.0 interval=5.0
API availability: Checking anchore-engine URL (http://localhost:8228)...
API availability: Success.
Service availability: Checking for service set (catalog,apiext,policy_engine,simplequeue,analyzer)...
Service availability: Success.
Feed sync: Checking sync completion for feed set (vulnerabilities)...
Feed sync: Success.
```

### Logs

If you are running into feed sync failures a good place to begin investigation is the the policy engine service logs (`/var/log/anchore/anchore-policy-engine.log`)

## My image won't analyze

Image analysis is performed as a distinct, asynchronous, and scheduled task driven by queues that analyzer workers periodically poll. Image records have a small state-machine as follows:

**Note:** In order for an image to move from 'not_analyzed' to 'analyzing', you need a healthy catalog, simplequeue, and analyzer service up and running. See the verifying services section in the [General Troubleshooting Approach Guide](general.md) for more information.

### Logs

If you run into issues with images failing analysis a good place to start inspecting is the analyzer logs (`/var/log/anchore/anchore-worker.log`)

The analyzer is the only component that can set an image state to 'analysis_failed', so you should be able to see a record of what happened. 

## Unable to access private registry

Anchore Engine will attempt to download images from any registry without requiring further configuration.
However if your registry requires authentication then the registry and corresponding credentials will need to be defined.

### The --insecure option

Anchore Engine will only pull images from a TLS/SSL enabled registry. If the registry is protected with a self signed certificate or a certificated signed by an unknown certificate authority then the `--insecure` option can be passed which instructs the Anchore Engine not to validate the certificate.

`anchore-cli registry add REGISTRY USERNAME PASSWORD --insecure`

### The --skip-validate option

Anchore Engine attempts to perform a credential validation upon registry addition, but there are cases where a credential can be valid but the validation routine can fail (in particular, credential validation methods are changing for public registries over time).  If you are unable to add a registry but believe that the credential you are providing is valid, or you wish to add a credential to anchore before it is in place in the registry, you can bypass the registry credential validation process using the `--skip-validate` option to the 'registry add' command.

`anchore-cli registry add REGISTRY USERNAME PASSWORD --skip-validate`
